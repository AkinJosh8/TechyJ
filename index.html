            <h2> Technical Feasibility </h2>
            <p>Shoe making is neither an easy production system nor a simple business.
                It requires high skill and a lot of diverse knowledge in many aspects 
                that may affect the quality, the appearance and the function of the shoe.
                The significant thing is that it requires a lot of work which makes shoe 
                making as a typical labor-intensive process.</p>

                    <img src="/TechyJ/shoed.png" width="550" height="350">
                    <p>The Shoe designs process starts with research. Here, the designer do
                    market and competitor analyses to determine the cost, material, trend,
                    gaps, and opportunities. Designing entails sketching shoe models and 
                    shoe lasts. Some designers sketch by hand while others use the software.
                    The resulting templates are crucial to the later stages of the shoe 
                    production process. <a href="https://italianshoefactory.com/blog/how-to-become-a-shoe-designer/">Read more. </a> </p>

                    <h3>STAMPING:</h3>
                    <img src="/TechyJ/stamping.png" width="550" height="350">
                    <p>Each shoe comprises more than 30 different parts using several advanced materials. 
                    During the footwear manufacturing process,these parts have to be marked to fit the design.
                    That makes the stamping process. During this stage the pieces of leather that make the shaft
                    are marked to prevent confusion during the sewing stage. Markings are made to show where
                    eyelets are punched. Also the edges of each shaft piece are thinned to make it easy for
                    pieces to be attached later on. <a href="https://mainandtaylorshoes.com/blogs/new/how-a-shoe-is-made#:~:text=Stamping%20the%20shoe%20materials%20is,confusion%20in%20the%20sewing%20phase"> Read more.</a> </p>

                    <img src="/TechyJ/assmb.png" width="550" height="350">  
                    <p>This is the core component of the shoemaking process. Assembling is a step in the shoe
                    production process where all the pieces, including the one that was just sewn, are fitted
                    to form finished shoes. During the assembly stage, the upper is bonded to the outsole.
                    But before this happens, the insole is temporarily attached to the lasts with nails and
                    the rubber ridge is placed on the insole to allow the shaft to be sewn to welt later on.
                    The upper is lasted and pulled tight to give the shoe its final shape. It's then joined
                    with the insole with hot glue and nails. This process takes about 2 hours to 3 weeks to
                    complete. <a href="https://lahormadetunegocio.com/2022/06/04/assembly-process/"> Continue here. </a></p>
